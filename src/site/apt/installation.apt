Deployment

 You will need to do some configuration work upfront.

  * Add a new directory "arsnova" in /etc and create a copy of moodle-connector.properties.example named moodle-connector.properties in this directory.
  
  * Change settings to match your environment

Server configuration

 In order to build up a full featured server installation you have to install at least the following services:
  
  * Apache Tomcat 7.0.29 (or newer)
  
  * Apache Webserver 2.2 or newer with buildin mod_proxy, mod_proxy_ajp and mod_proxy_http
 
 Make sure all services are installed. Next step is to configure the Apache Webserver. Find the configuration file or create a new one for use with a virtal host. This depends on your needs. At least you should have a configuration containing these settings:

+--------------------------------------------------------+
	
	<Location />
		ProxyPass ajp://127.0.0.1:8009/
		ProxyPassReverse ajp://127.0.0.1:8009/
	</Location>
	
+--------------------------------------------------------+

 All other requests will be send to your Apache Tomcat servlet container, using AJP running on port 8009.

 To enable the needed Apache Webserver simply type:

+---------------------------+
 
  # a2enmod proxy
  # a2enmod proxy_ajp
  # a2enmod proxy_http
 
+---------------------------+

 The configuration is ready for development usage. 

 Finally you should (re)start all services. The connector is now listening on HTTP port 80.

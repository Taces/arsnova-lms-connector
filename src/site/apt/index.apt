ARSnova Connector Service

 
 The ARSnova Connector Service is an easy to use connector to retrieve information about courses and to use them
 in ARSnova.
 
 The main goals are to check if a user is enlisted in a course and to get a list of all courses a user is enlisted
 with an administrative role.
 
 These informations are needed for new features proposed for later versions of ARSnova 2.
